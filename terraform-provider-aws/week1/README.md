# terraform-provider-aws

An open-source plugin that enables you to manage AWS resources as code using Terraform.

## Introduction

Terraform is a leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to manage your infrastructure through code.  
With Terraform, you define providers and use the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to create and manage AWS resources.

The `terraform-provider-aws` is maintained by a small team at HashiCorp and is continuously updated to support new AWS services and features.
